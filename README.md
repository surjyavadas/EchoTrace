# 🚨 EchoTrace  
### 🧠 Community Early-Warning System using Google Gemini

EchoTrace is an AI-powered early-warning system that transforms **human observations** into **actionable risk insights**.  
It helps detect potential dangers **before they escalate** by combining **Google Gemini**, **Firebase**, and **Google Maps**.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Many real-world incidents (🔥 electrical fires, ⚠️ unsafe zones, 🏗️ infrastructure failures) do not occur suddenly.  
They begin with **small warning signs** like:
- Strange smells  
- Unusual sounds  
- Repeated complaints  

These signals are often ignored and never connected.

👉 **EchoTrace captures these early signals and visualizes risk escalation.**

---

## 💡 Solution
EchoTrace allows users to report observations, which are then:
1. 🧠 Analyzed by **Google Gemini AI**
2. 📦 Stored as structured risk data in **Firebase Firestore**
3. 🗺️ Visualized as **risk zones on Google Maps**

This creates a **community memory** of early warning signals.
